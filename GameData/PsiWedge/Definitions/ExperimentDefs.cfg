		KerbinSrfSplashed = The water is definitely alive. All of these creepy looking things are different species of plankton.
		KerbinSrfSplashedShores = The plankton near the shores are predominantely algae but also protozoa. There seems to be an herbivore ecosystem going on here.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = The water is definitely alive. We're seeing some shapes and sizes of plankton of all sorts here, and they are abundant in spite of, or because of, the abundances of organic compounds released by the abundant hydrothermal vents on this world.
		LaytheSrfSplashed = This is odd. We haven't noticed any life. Perhaps something in this biome is precluding the existence of microbes.
		LaytheSrfSplashedShores = This is a pleasant surprise. There's a dense population of algae here. Perhaps the algae arises from periods of dryness on the surface due to low tide.
