# Psi Wedge
Made with permission from the creators of the Universal Storage 2 mod and aimed at compatibility with the Wild Blue Industries suite of mods and adding value to undersea exploration and microsat design. Notable features include:
- Racks have height variants (1, 2 or 4 rows). The 2.5m and Buffalo2 racks contain WBI science processors.
- Integrated probe body wedges which include solar panel, battery, RCS and are cargo bays or inventory parts.
- Experiment wedges are designed to require time and resources when started and only work when submerged. One or more experiments are concerned with ocean life and won't function on planets that are not whitelisted. As they may require several in-game days, submarine vessels have more reason to wait and hang around.
- MilliKit boxes fit the cargo bay wedges or will precisely fill the solar inventory wedges. The boxes' features can be installed into the host part (primarily the solar inventory wedge) via the WIP Rackmount mod.
- High-volume (relatively, without the nerf of stock balancing) battery wedges can hold generous amounts of ElectricCharge.

## Pending Issues
- Some wedge experiments are intended to have defined negative (undersea) altitude ranges. This feature does not appear to function. The affected experiments are the Bathymetry series and Goo Evolution series.
- Metallic material is not used (yet) where it should be, such as the solar panels.
- Indicator Lights integration might not work properly on the Millikit experiments.
- Indicator Lights integration does not work on the experiment wedges. They do not use stock modules.

## Dependencies
- B9 Part Switch

## Recommends
- RackMount (WIP, not on CKAN)
